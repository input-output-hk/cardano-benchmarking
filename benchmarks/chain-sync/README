This is a benchmark for syncing the mainnet chain from an external or local node.

Run Benchmark
=============

For convenience, the script 'start.sh' will launch in a 'tmux' session a local byron-proxy and initiate the benchmark. One can then switch between windows for the proxy and the node and follow its output.


Cardano Byron proxy
===================

In case you choose to sync from a local node, make sure that 'cardano-byron-proxy' is running and listening on port 7777 of localhost.
The script `./prepare-byron-proxy.sh` updates the code of the byron-proxy and compiles it using 'cabal'.
Then, run the local proxy with the script `./launch_mainnet_proxy.sh`.


Benchmark
=========

Run the benchmark using the script './benchmark-chain-sync-mainnet.sh'

It will run until maximum CPU time is used. Adapt this limit in the script file.
