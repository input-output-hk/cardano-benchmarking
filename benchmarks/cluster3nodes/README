### database

* access authentication

get the credentials how to connect to a PostgreSQL instance (version 9.x or 10.x).

add them to the file `configuration/pgpass`.

example:
```
localhost:5432:cl3demo:cl3demo:verysecure
```

* database user

the database `cl3demo` will be created as the user `cl3demo`.

make sure this user exists in the database you are connecting to, and it has the right to create new databases.
(created using a `CREATE USER` command)
